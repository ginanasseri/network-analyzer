# Network Analyzer

This repo contains two packet analysis programs that parse packet capture files to extract network statistics and display them in human-readable form:

## TCP Analysis

Processes TCP trace files, tracking connection states, calculate round-trip times, and count packets and data/sent received in completed connections.

## Traceroute Analysis
Aanalyzes a trace of IP datagrams created with traceroute: lists the IP address for the source, destination, and all intermediate nodes visited in order; calculates round-trip times and fragment statistics. 

Note: each directory contains a README explaining directory contents and usage of each program.
